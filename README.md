# Financial Toolkit üíπ

This is an open-source Python üêç library that implements the most commonly used functions that are frequently used by an investment professional.

This is still in the early stage of development but I will keep adding new features over time. Here are some of the features implemented so far:

- Getting financial data
- Portfolio optimization
- Peer group analysis
- Factor analysis
- Option pricing

### Installation
```sh
pip install fintoolkit
```

### Documentation

The API doc is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://chris-kc-cheng.github.io/financial-toolkit/toolkit.html).

### Jupyter Notebooks üìî

Jupyter is browser-based shell that allows user to interact with Python scripts.

In this repository, I have developed some Jupyter notebooks showing the most common use cases in investment management that utilizes the Financial Toolkit.

No Python? No problem. With Binder, you may interact with the Jupyter notebooks in an executable environment even without Python installed in your computer.
